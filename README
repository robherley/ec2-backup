HW6 - ec2-backup

The Solution
============

For the second iteration of the assignment, I strayed away from just executing
shell commands in Python, and instead used the official AWS SDK, boto3. Using
the SDK, I created a class (EC2Backup) that created the following control flow
when instantiated:

> Parse Command Args
> Check Env Variables
> Check Source Exists, and Read Access, Compute Size in GiB
> Is the Volume is Provided?
  Yes > Check AZ and Size
  No  > Create a New Volume twice size of 


Learning From Mistakes
======================

- exit handler
- boto3 waiters and aws ec2 wait


Python and Boto3
================

For the second rendition of the assignment, I again chose Python (3.7). 

Problems Encountered
====================

- size conversions
